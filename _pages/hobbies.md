## Violin

I've been playing the violin since the age of 10. I've passed ABRSM 3rd grade with a distinction at the age of 12. My current level is probably 7th grade. I'm an active member in my school's student orchestra, in which I both play the violin and manage the reimbursement.

## Piano

I've been playing the piano since the age of 6. I've passed ABRSM 8th grade with a distinction at the age of 10. I enjoy playing music written during the classical and romantic period. I like Mozart, especially his sonatas K.310 and K.311. I like Chopin, expecially his mazurka Op.50 No.3 and piano concerto No.1.

## MBTI

I'm an ISTJ/ISTP. My energy (the first letter) and nature (the third letter) are obviously tilted. My mind (the second letter) and tactics (the fourth letter) are rather neutral. Interestingly, my tactics flunctuate periodically, perhaps due to me being at school or at home.
