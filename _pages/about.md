My name is Congzhe Yan. I am currently an undergraduate in USTC.

I was born in Anhui albeit not in Hefei in July 2007. I was admitted to Beijing No.8 High School Experimental and Creative Education Program in Fall 2018. I was admitted to the School of Gifted Young in Fall 2022. I was at that time interested in Chemistry rather than Physics. But after a year of learning, I feel more interested in Physics. I went for it.

Then came my sophomore year. I joined the Yan Jici Talent Program in Physics in Fall 2023. I was vague interested in Quantum Optics and joined Professor Xiaoye Xu's laboratory in November 2023. I read the books written by Agarwal and Scully and audited the Quantum Optics course. Unfortunately after half a year of exploring, I found Quantum Optics was not the right thing for me and left the laboratory. I was clearly more interested in Condensed Matter Theory and join Professor Zhenyu Zhang's laboratory in June 2024.

I'm looking forward to the start of the new semester.
