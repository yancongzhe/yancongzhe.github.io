My name is Congzhe Yan. I am currently an undergraduate in USTC.

I was born in Anhui albeit not in Hefei in July 2007. I was admitted to the School of Gifted Young in Fall 2022. I joined the Yan Jici Talent Program in Physics in Fall 2023. I am now interested in Condensed Matter Theory and my mentor is Professor Zhenyu Zhang.
